# ðŸŽ® Odd or Even

This is one of my first projects that helped me understand how HTML, CSS and JS work together. 

It is a simple game, where the player has a limited amount of time to pick if the displayed number is odd or even.

The game can be previewed [here](https://dianagatcan.github.io/Odd-or-Even/).
